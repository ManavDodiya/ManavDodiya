# 👋 Hi, I'm Manav

🚀 Passionate about building intuitive and impactful **Android apps** using **Jetpack Compose** and modern **MVVM architecture**.

🎯 Currently exploring the intersection of **design and code**, I love bringing ideas to life through clean, functional UI and robust backend integrations like **Room**, **Retrofit**, and **Firebase**.

🎓 I'm a Computer Science student constantly learning by doing — from music players and notes apps to startup concepts like a resale platform for students.
